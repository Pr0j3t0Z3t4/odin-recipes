<p>Chiken Parmesan Ingredients unodered list:</p>

<p>1 cup all-purpose flour

3 eggs

12 ounces Italian-seasoned bread crumbs

6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, or more to taste, divided

2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce, or more to taste

12 slices mozzarella cheese

1 (3 ounce) package Parmesan cheese

2 tablespoons oregano

2 tablespoons basil

1 tablespoon garlic powder</p>
<p>Step-by-step for Chicken Parmesan preparation:</p>

<p>Spread flour on a shallow plate. Beat eggs in a bowl. Pour bread crumbs into a shallow bowl. Dredge 1 chicken breast in flour; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place the breaded chicken breast, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts</p>
<p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry breaded chicken breasts, two at a time, until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining butter and chicken breasts.
